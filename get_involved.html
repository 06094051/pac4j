    	<h1>Help us build the greatest security library for Java</h1>
      <p>Hi,</p>
      <p />
      <p>I'm the creator and main developer of <code>pac4j</code> and this is a call for contributors.</p>
      <p><code>pac4j</code> is both:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>a <a href="https://github.com/pac4j/pac4j" target="_blank">core library</a> to handle authentication/user profile retrieval for almost all protocols: OAuth, CAS, OpenID, SAML, HTTP, OpenID Connect, GAE and thus for Facebook, Twitter, Google, Yahoo, etc. Most of the logic is here (around 31 000 lines of source code)</li>
      <li>a set of bridges / implementations (a few classes) to use this core engine in many frameworks/environments: <a href="https://github.com/Jasig/cas/tree/master/cas-server-support-pac4j" target="_blank">CAS</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pac4j/j2e-pac4j" target="_blank">J2E</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pac4j/play-pac4j" target="_blank">Play</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pac4j/spring-security-pac4j" target="_blank">Spring Security</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bujiio/buji-pac4j" target="_blank">Shiro</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ratpack/ratpack/tree/master/ratpack-pac4j" target="_blank">Ratpack</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pac4j/vertx-pac4j" target="_blank">Vertx</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pac4j/undertow-pac4j" target="_blank">Undertow</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pac4j/spark-pac4j" target="_blank">Spark</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><code>pac4j</code> is easy. It relies on one core class / concept: the <a href="https://github.com/pac4j/pac4j/blob/master/pac4j-core/src/main/java/org/pac4j/core/client/Client.java" target="_blank">client</a>.</p>
      <p><code>pac4j</code> is consistent across various protocols (while even great ecosystem like Spring offers many different libraries: spring-security-cas, spring-security-saml, Spring Social...)</p>
      <p><code>pac4j</code> libraries are very similar in their use and even in their implementations, whether the frameworks use handlers, filters, routes... Only two filters: one to protect a resource and one to finish the authentication process.</p>
      <p>The roadmap ahead is promising: while <code>pac4j</code> was primarily focused on stateful mechanisms, it should be fairly straightforward to address stateless authentications for REST web services, as well as to support authorizations or whatever you may think of.</p>
      <p>Maintaining and developing everything is a tremendous job and that's why we are looking for regular committers. To bring <code>pac4j</code> to the next level: to make it the greatest security library for Java!</p>
      <p><strong>Why should you get involved?</strong></p>
      <p>It's me, Michaël, a bunch of casual contributors and all pac4j users you will help, not a big company trying to make you work for free.</p>
      <p>Security is a core issue in applications development, a matter you should be interested in.</p>
      <p>We are nice guys ;-)</p>
      <p><strong>How to?</strong></p>
      <p>The easiest way is to clone the source code (the core and the implementations you may be interested in) and take a look at the latest issues which are the incoming roadmap.</p>
      <p>You can also use the mailing lists for questions: <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/pac4j-users" target="_blank">pac4j users</a> and <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/pac4j-dev" target="_blank">pac4j developers</a>.</p>
