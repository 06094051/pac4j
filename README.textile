h2. What is ScribeUP ?

ScribeUP (for Scribe User Profile) is a web-oriented extension for the "Scribe":http://wiki.github.com/fernandezpablo85/scribe-java library. It retrieves the profile of a user after this user has been authenticated by an OAuth provider. It's available under the Apache 2 license.
Take a look at the "technical description of the project":https://github.com/leleuj/scribe-up/wiki/Technical-description. Browse the "Javadoc":http://javadoc.leleuj.cloudbees.net/.

h2. Who uses ScribeUP ?

* Everybody can use ScribeUP by following the "sample":https://github.com/leleuj/scribe-up/wiki/Sample.
* However, the library was created to be the foundation of the "cas-server-support-oauth":https://wiki.jasig.org/display/CASUM/OAuth module, which adds OAuth support to the "CAS server":http://www.jasig.org/cas (version 3.5.0). A demo is available at : "https://github.com/leleuj/cas-oauth-demo-3.5.0":https://github.com/leleuj/cas-oauth-demo-3.5.0.
* ScribeUP is also used to propose a shiro-oauth module to add OAuth client support to the "Shiro project":http://shiro.apache.org : the "JIRA ticket":https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO-119 and the "associated discussion":http://shiro-developer.582600.n2.nabble.com/Add-OAuth-support-for-Shiro-td7240738.html. A demo is available at : "https://github.com/leleuj/scribe-up-shiro-demo":https://github.com/leleuj/scribe-up-shiro-demo.
* The library is also integrated in my "Spring Security OAuth client library":https://github.com/leleuj/spring-security-oauth-client which adds OAuth client support to Spring Security. A demo is available at : "https://github.com/leleuj/spring-security-oauth-client-demo":https://github.com/leleuj/spring-security-oauth-client-demo.
