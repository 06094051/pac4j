h2. What is ScribeUP ?

ScribeUP (for Scribe User Profile) is a web library to retrieve the profile of a user after this user has been authenticated by an OAuth provider. It's based on "Scribe":http://wiki.github.com/fernandezpablo85/scribe-java and available under the Apache 2 license.
Take a look at the "technical description of the project":https://github.com/leleuj/scribe-up/wiki/Technical-description. Browse the "Javadoc":http://javadoc.leleuj.cloudbees.net/.

h2. Who uses ScribeUP ?

* Everybody can use ScribeUP by following the "sample":https://github.com/leleuj/scribe-up/wiki/Sample.
* However, the library was first created to be the foundation of the "cas-server-support-oauth":https://wiki.jasig.org/display/CASUM/OAuth module, which adds OAuth support to the "CAS server":http://www.jasig.org/cas. CAS OAuth module 3.5.0 is based on ScribeUP 1.0.0 (a demo is available at : "https://github.com/leleuj/cas-oauth-demo-3.5.0":https://github.com/leleuj/cas-oauth-demo-3.5.0 ) whereas CAS OAuth module 3.5.1 is based on ScribeUP 1.1.0. (a demo is available at "https://github.com/leleuj/cas-oauth-demo":https://github.com/leleuj/cas-oauth-demo ).
* ScribeUP is also used to propose to add OAuth client support to the "Shiro project":http://shiro.apache.org : the Shiro OAuth module is available at : "https://github.com/bujiio/buji-oauth":https://github.com/bujiio/buji-oauth. A demo is available at : "https://github.com/leleuj/scribe-up-shiro-demo":https://github.com/leleuj/scribe-up-shiro-demo.
* The library is also integrated in my "Spring Security OAuth client library":https://github.com/leleuj/spring-security-oauth-client which adds OAuth client support to Spring Security. A demo is available at : "https://github.com/leleuj/spring-security-oauth-client-demo":https://github.com/leleuj/spring-security-oauth-client-demo.
